## Overview

Phishing is a cyber attack method that relies on social engineering to trick users into revealing confidential information. This project provides a detailed analysis of phishing attack techniques, detection mechanisms, and defense strategies. It aims to educate users and cybersecurity professionals about current phishing threats and future defense mechanisms using real-world case studies and research-backed data.
